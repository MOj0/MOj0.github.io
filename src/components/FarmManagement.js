                As I wanted to try out mobile development, I figured I should make my own Android app.
                <br />
                I learned how to use Android Studio and the basics of mobile app development. I used Java for this project,
                since I know it better than Kotlin and I wanted this to be about mobile development, not about learning a new
                language.
                <br />
                The app has 3 sections:
                <ul>
                    <li>Area section: where one can create areas of the farm (using the Google Map's API) and bind tasks to them</li>
                    <li>Dashboard: where all tasks all listed and new ones can be created</li>
                    <li>Calendar section: where one can see the calendar of upcoming tasks and create tasks with specific due dates</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                It took me longer than expected, but I learned a lot about Android Studio and mobile app development in general.
