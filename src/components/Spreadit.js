                This is a project made for the Infomation Systems class.
                Unfortunately the repository is private and I'm not the owner, so
                you can't see the code.
                <br/>
                We created a webapp using <code>C#</code> and <code>.NET 6</code>. I learned
                how the MVC (Model-View-Controller) works, how to set up a database in such
                environement and connect to it through the backend. I also learned how to properly
                store information about users (mainly passwords), authenticate and authorize them.
                <br/>
                Lastly, we created an Android app which uses the same backend API, so funcionality stays the same,
                only the view changes.
                <br/>
                We were both very happy with the result, since we created a fully functional web (and mobile) application.
